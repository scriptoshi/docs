title: "Vesting/Lock Contract"
description: "Manages token locks and vesting schedules for team, investors, and operators"
---

## Overview

The Vesting/Lock Contract manages all token locks across team members, investors, stakers, and shop operators. It supports multiple vesting schedules with cliff periods and linear unlock mechanisms.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Vesting Schedules:** Supports different vesting periods for different beneficiaries
- **Cliff Periods:** Enforces minimum lock periods before any tokens begin vesting
- **Conditional Release:** Tokens only vest when associated shops meet payout thresholds
- **Linear Unlock:** Gradual token release over specified periods
- **Admin Controls:** Managed by multisig wallet for security

## Vesting Schedules

| Recipient | Cliff | Vesting Period | Condition |
|-----------|-------|---------------|-----------|
| Team | 6 months | 12-month linear | Shop must begin payouts |
| Investors | 6 months | 6-month linear | Shop must begin payouts |
| Stakers | 3 months | Monthly distribution | Shop must be cash-flow positive |
| Shop Operator | 6 months | 12-month linear | Performance-based |
| Treasury | No cliff | Governance-controlled | Proposal + vote required |

## Critical Conditions

<Warning>
**No tokens vest until the associated shop starts making payouts.** If a shop fails to become profitable, the associated tokens remain locked indefinitely.
</Warning>

This design aligns everyone's incentives toward making the businesses succeed.
