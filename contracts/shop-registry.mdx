## Overview

The Shop Registry Contract maintains a permanent, tamper-proof record of every shop in the SHAWARMA.TRADE network. It serves as the source of truth for shop status, performance, and historical data.

## Key Features

- **Immutable Records:** Permanent on-chain history of all shops
- **Shop Status Tracking:** Monitor active, paused, and closed shops
- **Performance Metrics:** Store cumulative revenue and tokens burned per shop
- **Operator Registry:** Track which operator manages each shop
- **Location Data:** Store shop location information

## Shop Information Stored

Each shop record contains:
- **Shop ID:** Unique identifier
- **Location:** City and country
- **Operator Address:** Ethereum address of shop operator
- **Launch Date:** Timestamp of shop opening
- **Status:** Pilot, Active, Paused, or Closed
- **Cumulative Tokens Burned:** Total SHAMA burned from this shop
- **Total Revenue Reported:** Historical revenue data

## Shop Status Types

|--------|-------------|
| Pilot | One of the first 4 team-operated shops |

| Paused | Temporarily closed (maintenance, relocation, etc.) |
| Closed | Permanently closed |
