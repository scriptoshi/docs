description: "Token staking with configurable lock durations and governance weight"
---

## Overview

The Staking Contract allows SHAMA token holders to stake their tokens to earn rewards and participate in governance. It supports multiple lock durations with different reward multipliers and governance weights.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Staking Tiers:** Flexible, Bronze, Silver, and Gold tiers
- **Reward Multipliers:** Longer locks earn higher rewards
- **Governance Weight:** Staked tokens grant voting power proportional to lock duration
- **Shop Launch Rewards:** Staking rewards come from new shop token allocations
- **Flexible Unstaking:** Can withdraw after lock period expires

## Staking Tiers

| Tier | Lock Duration | Reward Multiplier | Governance Weight |
|------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Flexible | No lock | 1.0x | 1.0x |
| Bronze | 3 months | 1.25x | 1.25x |
| Silver | 6 months | 1.5x | 1.5x |
| Gold | 12 months | 2.0x | 2.0x |

## How Staking Rewards Work

<Info>
Staking rewards are **not** paid from shop profits (those go to buyback-and-burn). Instead, staking rewards come from the staker allocation of each new shop setup.
</Info>

When Shop #5 launches, 5,000 SHAMA (25% of 20,000) are allocated to the staking pool. These tokens are distributed to stakers proportionally based on their staked amount and lock duration.

**This means: staking rewards are tied to expansion.** More shops launching = more rewards for stakers.

## Functions

### Core Functions
- `stake(uint256 amount, uint8 tier)` - Stake tokens with chosen tier
- `unstake()` - Withdraw tokens after lock period
- `claimRewards()` - Claim earned staking rewards
- `getStakingInfo(address staker)` - View staking position details

### View Functions
- `calculateRewards(address staker)` - Calculate pending rewards
- `getGovernanceWeight(address staker)` - Get voting power
- `getTotalStaked()` - View total staked in contract

<Note>
**Coming Soon:** Detailed technical documentation, contract addresses, and ABIs will be added after contract deployment.

## Example: Staking Comparison

User A stakes 1,000 SHAMA in Flexible tier:
- Reward multiplier: 1.0x
- Governance weight: 1,000

User B stakes 1,000 SHAMA in Gold tier (12 months):
- Reward multiplier: 2.0x (earns 2x more rewards)
- Governance weight: 2,000 (2x voting power)

## Security

- No admin withdrawal functions
- Emergency pause function (multisig controlled)
- Third-party audit pending
