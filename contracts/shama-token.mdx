description: "Standard ERC-20 with burn function and fixed supply"
---

## Overview

The SHAMA Token Contract is a standard ERC-20 implementation with burn functionality. It has a fixed supply of 1,000,000 tokens minted at genesis with no ability to mint additional tokens.

## Key Features

- **Fixed Supply:** 1,000,000 SHAMA tokens minted at genesis
- **Burn Function:** Tokens can be permanently burned, reducing total supply
- **No Mint Function:** Supply can only decrease, never increase
- **ERC-20 Standard:** Fully compatible with all ERC-20 infrastructure
