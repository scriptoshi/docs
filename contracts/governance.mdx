title: "Governance Contract"
description: "On-chain proposal and voting system for strategic decisions"
---

## Overview

The Governance Contract enables SHAMA token holders to function as a decentralized board of directors. It handles proposal submission, voting, and execution of approved governance actions.

## Key Features

- **On-Chain Proposals:** Transparent proposal submission and tracking
- **Weighted Voting:** Voting power based on staked amount and lock duration
- **Quorum Requirements:** Minimum participation for valid votes
- **Timelock Execution:** Security delay on approved proposals
- **Emergency Proposals:** Fast-track process for urgent situations

## What Governance Controls

### Strategic Decisions (Require Vote)
- Approval of new shop locations
- Selection of shop operators
- Major budget allocations
- Changes to franchise fee structure
- Adjustments to buyback-and-burn percentage
- Removal of underperforming operators
- Changes to staking parameters
- Use of treasury/reserve funds
- Partnership and listing decisions

### Operational Decisions (NOT Voted On)
<Warning>
These are handled by operators, NOT voted on by governance:
- Daily staffing and scheduling
- Ingredient sourcing and menu execution
- Customer service
- Local marketing and promotions
- Equipment maintenance
- Health and safety compliance
</Warning>

## Proposal Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Submission">
    Any staker holding ≥ 0.1% of staked supply can submit a proposal
  </Step>
  <Step title="Discussion Period">
    7 days for community discussion and debate
  </Step>
  <Step title="Voting Period">
    5 days for on-chain voting. Quorum requirement: 20% of staked supply must participate
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execution">
    Approved proposals are executed by the operations team within 30 days
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Emergency Proposals

In urgent situations (equipment failure, safety issues), the team can:
1. Act immediately to resolve the issue
2. Submit a retroactive ratification vote within 48 hours
3. Community votes to approve or reject the emergency action

## Voting Power

```
Voting Power = (Staked SHAMA Amount) × (Tier Multiplier)
```

**Example:**
- User with 1,000 SHAMA in Gold tier (12-month lock) = 2,000 voting power
- User with 1,000 SHAMA in Flexible tier = 1,000 voting power

This rewards commitment and prevents governance attacks from short-term speculators.

## Functions

- `propose()` - Submit a new proposal
- `vote(uint256 proposalId, bool support)` - Cast a vote
- `execute(uint256 proposalId)` - Execute approved proposal (after timelock)
- `cancel(uint256 proposalId)` - Cancel proposal (proposer only)

### View Functions
- `getProposal(uint256 proposalId)` - View proposal details
- `getVotes(address voter)` - Check voting power
- `getProposalState(uint256 proposalId)` - Check proposal status

### Admin Functions
- `setQuorum(uint256 newQuorum)` - Adjust quorum requirement (requires governance vote)
- `setVotingPeriod(uint256 period)` - Adjust voting duration (requires governance vote)

<Note>
**Coming Soon:** Detailed technical documentation, contract addresses, and ABIs will be added after contract deployment.

## Security

- Timelock on execution (48-hour delay)
- Quorum requirements prevent low-participation attacks
