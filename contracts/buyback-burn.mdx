title: "Buyback-and-Burn Contract"
description: "Executes market buys and permanent token burns from shop profits"
---

## Overview

The Buyback-and-Burn Contract is the core value engine of the protocol. It receives funds from shop operations, executes market buys of SHAMA on DEXs, and permanently burns all purchased tokens.

## Key Features

- **Automated Buybacks:** Executes market buys on designated DEX
- **Permanent Burns:** All purchased tokens are sent to burn address
- **Full Transparency:** Every buy and burn is recorded on-chain
- **TWAP Execution:** Time-weighted average pricing to minimize market impact
- **Public Tracking:** All transactions visible on dashboard

## How It Works

1. Shop's net profit is calculated monthly (revenue minus operating costs)
2. Designated percentage of profit (initially 50%, adjustable by governance) is converted to on-chain currency
3. Funds are sent to the Buyback-and-Burn contract
4. Contract executes market buys on the designated DEX
5. All purchased tokens are sent to burn address (`0x000...dead`)
6. Transaction is recorded on-chain with full details

## Burn Transparency

Every burn event is published with:
- Shop identifier
- Revenue for the period
- Operating costs for the period
- Net profit calculation
- Percentage allocated to burn
- DEX transaction hash for the buy
- Burn transaction hash
- Running total of tokens burned to date

<Info>
This data is displayed on the public dashboard and is independently verifiable on-chain.

## Functions

### Core Functions
- `executeBuyback()` - Executes market buy and burn (multisig or automated)
- `setBurnPercentage(uint256 percentage)` - Adjust burn allocation (governance controlled)
- `setDEX(address dexRouter)` - Update DEX router (governance controlled)

### View Functions
- `getTotalBurned()` - Total tokens burned to date
- `getBurnHistory()` - View burn transaction history
- `getNextBurnEstimate()` - Estimate next burn amount based on current profits

### Emergency Functions
- `pause()` - Pause buybacks (multisig controlled)
- `withdrawFunds()` - Emergency withdrawal (requires governance vote)

<Note>
**Coming Soon:** Detailed technical documentation, contract addresses, and ABIs will be added after contract deployment.

## Burn Impact Projections

<Warning>
These are illustrative estimates, not guarantees. Actual figures depend on shop performance, location, and market conditions.
</Warning>

| Scenario | Shops Active | Avg Monthly Profit/Shop | Burn Allocation (50%) | Monthly Buy Pressure |
|----------|-------------|------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Early (Year 1) | 4 | $3,000 | $1,500 | $6,000 |
| Growth (Year 2) | 15 | $4,000 | $2,000 | $30,000 |
| Scale (Year 3) | 40 | $5,000 | $2,500 | $100,000 |

The key insight: **burn pressure compounds.** Each new profitable shop adds permanent, recurring buy pressure.

## Security

- Multisig controlled execution
- Rate limiting on buybacks
- Maximum slippage protection
- Third-party audit pending
