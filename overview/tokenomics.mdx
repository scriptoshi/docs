## The SHAMA Token

| Property | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Name | SHAMA |
| Total Supply | 1,000,000 (fixed at genesis) |
| Type | ERC-20 (with burn function) |
| Inflation | None — supply only decreases |
| Direct Yield | None — no profit distribution to holders |
| Value Accrual | Deflationary pressure via buyback-and-burn |
| Governance | Staked tokens grant voting power |
| Network | TBD (Ethereum L2 / Solana / Base) |

## What SHAMA Is

A governance and deflationary utility token backed by the revenue mechanics of real physical businesses.

## What SHAMA Is Not

A security, a profit-sharing instrument, or a promise of financial returns. No one is guaranteed anything. The community works together toward making the businesses successful, and the token mechanics reward long-term alignment.

## Total Supply & Allocation Per Shop

Total fixed supply: **1,000,000 SHAMA**

Tokens are released in tranches tied to each shop setup. Not all tokens are in circulation at launch — they unlock as the business expands.

### Pilot Phase (Shops 1–4): 10,000 tokens per shop

| Allocation | Percentage | Tokens |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| Team | 40% | 4,000 |
| Stakers | 30% | 3,000 |
| Investors | 30% | 3,000 |
| **Total per shop** | **100%** | **10,000** |

<Info>
The 40% team allocation during the pilot phase reflects the disproportionate effort required to build the franchise model from scratch.

### Growth Phase (Shops 5–50): 20,000 tokens per shop

| Allocation | Percentage | Tokens |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| Team | 20% | 4,000 |
| Stakers | 25% | 5,000 |
| Investors | 25% | 5,000 |
| Shop Operator | 15% | 3,000 |
| Treasury / Reserve | 10% | 2,000 |
| Liquidity | 5% | 1,000 |
| **Total per shop** | **100%** | **20,000** |

## Supply Math

| Phase | Shops | Tokens/Shop | Subtotal |
|-------|-------|-------------|----------|
| Pilot | 4 | 10,000 | 40,000 |
| Growth | 46 | 20,000 | 920,000 |
| **Total allocated** | **50** | — | **960,000** |
| Ecosystem reserve | — | — | 40,000 |
| **Grand total** | — | — | **1,000,000** |

The remaining 40,000 tokens in the ecosystem reserve are held for: emergency liquidity needs, strategic partnerships, exchange listings, and unforeseen operational requirements. Usage requires governance approval.

## Vesting Schedule

All token allocations are subject to vesting. No one receives unlocked tokens at shop launch.

| Recipient | Cliff | Vesting Period | Condition |
|-----------|-------|---------------|-----------|
| Team | 6 months | 12-month linear | Shop must begin payouts |
| Investors | 6 months | 6-month linear | Shop must begin payouts |
| Stakers | 3 months | Monthly distribution | Shop must be cash-flow positive |
| Shop Operator | 6 months | 12-month linear | Performance-based |
| Treasury | No cliff | Governance-controlled | Proposal + vote required |

<Warning>
**Critical condition:** No tokens vest until the associated shop starts making payouts. If a shop fails to become profitable, the associated tokens remain locked.
</Warning>

## Staking Model

### Purpose

Staking serves two functions:
1. Provides governance weight (staked tokens = voting power)
2. Mechanism through which community members earn SHAMA from new shop launches

### Staking Tiers

| Tier | Lock Duration | Reward Multiplier | Governance Weight |
|------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Flexible | No lock | 1.0x | 1.0x |
| Bronze | 3 months | 1.25x | 1.25x |
| Silver | 6 months | 1.5x | 1.5x |
| Gold | 12 months | 2.0x | 2.0x |

Longer locks receive higher reward multipliers and greater voting weight. This rewards commitment and prevents governance attacks from short-term speculators.

## The Elegant Tension

The tokenomics create a natural balance:
- **Expansion emits tokens** (inflationary pressure from new shop allocations)
- **Operating shops burn tokens** (deflationary pressure from buyback-and-burn)
- **At scale**, burn rate exceeds emission rate, and the token becomes net deflationary

<Info>
This crossover point — where active shops are burning more tokens than new shops are emitting — is when the flywheel fully engages.
