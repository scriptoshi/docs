## Overview

SHAWARMA.TRADE is a Decentralized Autonomous Business (DAB) protocol that bridges blockchain governance with real-world food service operations. Unlike traditional crypto projects built on speculation, SHAMA derives its value from actual revenue-generating businesses.

## The Problem

The crypto industry suffers from a fundamental credibility crisis. The vast majority of tokens are backed by nothing — no revenue, no product, no tangible value. When sentiment shifts, these tokens collapse because there is nothing underneath.

Meanwhile, real-world businesses generate consistent revenue but lack access to:
- Decentralized capital formation
- Transparent governance
- Global community participation

## The Solution: Decentralized Autonomous Business (DAB)

SHAWARMA.TRADE introduces the Decentralized Autonomous Business model — a hybrid structure where:
- **Physical businesses** are operated by professional managers
- **Strategic oversight** is conducted by token holders through on-chain governance

<Info>
This is not a DAO that votes on code deployments. This is a DAO that votes on real business decisions: where to open the next shop, whether to change suppliers, whether to replace an underperforming operator, how to allocate expansion capital.

## Core Principles

### Real Revenue
Every shop generates real income from real customers buying real food. This isn't yield farming or liquidity mining — it's commerce.

### Transparent Operations
- Livestreams from every shop
- On-chain sales dashboards
- Public financial reporting
- Token holders see everything

### Deflationary Mechanics
Shop profits buy and burn tokens. More shops = more burn. The token supply only goes down over time.

### Community Governance
Token holders act as a board of directors, making high-level strategic decisions while professional operators handle daily execution.

### No Direct Profit Distribution
Holders never receive profit payments. Value accrues through token scarcity. This is a critical design choice for both regulatory and economic reasons.

## The Business Loop

```
Customer buys shawarma
        ↓
Shop generates revenue
        ↓
Operating costs are paid (rent, staff, ingredients, equipment)
        ↓
Net profit is calculated (publicly visible on dashboard)
        ↓
Designated percentage of profit is sent to Buyback Contract
        ↓
Contract buys SHAMA on open market (DEX)
        ↓
Purchased tokens are permanently burned
        ↓
Total supply decreases → remaining tokens become scarcer
        ↓
Token holders benefit from reduced supply
