## The Three Loops

SHAWARMA.TRADE operates through three interconnected feedback loops that create a sustainable, transparent, and value-accruing system.

## 1. The Business Loop

```
Customer buys shawarma
        ↓
Shop generates revenue
        ↓
Operating costs are paid (rent, staff, ingredients, equipment)
        ↓
Net profit is calculated (publicly visible on dashboard)
        ↓
Designated percentage of profit is sent to Buyback Contract
        ↓
Contract buys SHAMA on open market (DEX)
        ↓
Purchased tokens are permanently burned
        ↓
Total supply decreases → remaining tokens become scarcer
```

## 2. The Governance Loop

```
Token holder stakes SHAMA
        ↓
Staking weight determines voting power
        ↓
Proposals are submitted on-chain (new locations, budget changes, operator reviews)
        ↓
Community votes during proposal window
        ↓
Approved proposals are executed by operations team
        ↓
Results are visible via livestream and dashboards
```

## 3. The Monitoring Loop

```
Livestream cameras at every shop (kitchen + front counter)
        ↓
POS (Point of Sale) data feeds to public dashboard
        ↓
Daily/weekly/monthly revenue, expenses, net profit — all visible
        ↓
Token holders can flag concerns via governance proposals
        ↓
Quarterly operator performance reviews driven by data
```

## Buyback-and-Burn Mechanism

This is the core value engine of the protocol.

### How It Works

1. Each shop's net profit is calculated monthly (revenue minus all operating costs)
2. A designated percentage of net profit (initially 50%, adjustable by governance) is converted to the token's trading currency
3. Funds are sent to the Buyback-and-Burn smart contract
4. The contract executes market buys of SHAMA on the designated DEX
5. All purchased tokens are sent to the burn address (0x000...dead) — permanently removed from supply
6. Every transaction is recorded on-chain with full transparency

<Warning>
These are illustrative estimates, not guarantees. Actual figures depend on shop performance, location, and market conditions.
</Warning>

## Transparency Layer

### Livestreams
Every operating shop has livestream cameras covering:
- **Kitchen area:** Food preparation, hygiene standards, workflow
- **Front counter / service area:** Customer flow, service quality
- **No audio** to protect employee and customer privacy

Streams are accessible 24/7 to all SHAMA stakers through the governance portal.

### Financial Dashboard
A public, real-time dashboard displaying per-shop and aggregate data:
- Daily transaction count and revenue
- Weekly and monthly revenue trends
- Operating cost breakdown
- Net profit calculation
- Buyback-and-burn execution history
- Cumulative tokens burned
- Token circulating supply

### Quarterly Reports
The operations team publishes quarterly reports covering:
- Financial performance per shop and aggregate
- Operator performance reviews
- Expansion progress and pipeline
- Governance activity summary
- Token supply and burn statistics
- Challenges, risks, and mitigation actions
