## Understanding Burn Transparency

Every burn event includes:
- Shop identifier
- Revenue for the period
- Operating costs
- Net profit calculation
- Percentage allocated to burn
- DEX buy transaction hash
- Burn transaction hash
- Running total burned

<Info>
All of this data is publicly verifiable on-chain and displayed on the dashboard.

## Key Metrics to Track

<Steps>
  <Step title="Total Burned">
    How many tokens have been permanently removed from supply
  </Step>
  <Step title="Burn Rate">
    How quickly tokens are being burned (monthly/quarterly)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Circulating Supply">
    Total supply minus burned tokens minus locked tokens
  </Step>
  <Step title="Per-Shop Performance">
    Which shops are contributing most to burns
  </Step>
</Steps>
