## Proposal Lifecycle

<Steps>
  <Step title="Submission">
    Proposal submitted on-chain (requires 0.1% of staked supply)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Discussion (7 days)">
    Community discusses and debates on Discord/forum
  </Step>
  <Step title="Voting (5 days)">
    On-chain voting period with 20% quorum requirement
  </Step>
  <Step title="Timelock (48 hours)">
    Security delay before execution
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execution (30 days)">
    Operations team implements approved proposal
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Voting Power Calculation

```
Your Voting Power = (Staked SHAMA) × (Tier Multiplier)
```

**Example:**
- 1,000 SHAMA in Flexible tier = 1,000 voting power
- 1,000 SHAMA in Gold tier (12mo lock) = 2,000 voting power

## Best Practices

<Tip>
**Writing Good Proposals:**
1. Be specific and clear about what you're proposing
2. Include rationale and expected outcomes
3. Provide cost estimates if applicable
4. Consider community feedback before formal submission
5. Include success metrics for evaluation
</Tip>
