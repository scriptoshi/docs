## What is SHAWARMA.TRADE?

SHAWARMA.TRADE is a Decentralized Autonomous Business (DAB) protocol that bridges blockchain governance with real-world fast food operations. We build and operate physical shawarma shops, with token holders serving as a decentralized board of directors.

**Every shawarma sold burns a token.**

## Core Principles
