## 1. Executive Summary

Shawarma.trade is a Decentralized Autonomous Business (DAB) protocol that bridges blockchain governance with real-world food service operations. The protocol builds and operates physical shawarma shops, with token holders serving as a decentralized board of directors who oversee strategic decisions, monitor operations via livestream, and benefit from a deflationary token model driven by real business revenue.

Unlike traditional crypto projects built on speculation, SHAMA derives its value from actual revenue-generating businesses. Profits from each shop are used to buy SHAMA tokens on the open market and permanently burn them, creating consistent deflationary pressure tied directly to real-world sales. No profit is distributed directly to holders — value accrues through supply reduction.

The protocol begins with 4 team-operated pilot shops to establish a proven franchise model, then scales to 50 shops through community-backed expansion, and ultimately transitions to a fully decentralized franchise system.

**Key figures:**

- Total supply: 1,000,000 SHAMA (fixed, deflationary)
- Pilot shops: 4 (team-operated)
- Scale target: 50 shops before franchise transition
- Revenue model: Buyback-and-burn from shop profits
- Governance: On-chain voting for strategic decisions

---

## 2. The Problem

The crypto industry suffers from a fundamental credibility crisis. The vast majority of tokens are backed by nothing — no revenue, no product, no tangible value. Prices are driven entirely by speculation, narrative, and market manipulation. When sentiment shifts, these tokens collapse because there is nothing underneath.

Meanwhile, real-world businesses generate consistent revenue but lack access to decentralized capital formation, transparent governance, and global community participation. A shawarma shop in Kampala cannot easily attract investment from someone in Berlin, nor can that investor meaningfully participate in the business's direction.

**The gap:** There is no widely adopted model for tokenizing real business operations in a way that is transparent, governed by stakeholders, and generates genuine economic value on-chain.

---

## 3. The Solution: Decentralized Autonomous Business (DAB)

Shawarma.trade introduces the Decentralized Autonomous Business model — a hybrid structure where physical businesses are operated by professional managers while strategic oversight is conducted by token holders through on-chain governance.

This is not a DAO that votes on code deployments. This is a DAO that votes on real business decisions: where to open the next shop, whether to change suppliers, whether to replace an underperforming operator, how to allocate expansion capital.

**Core principles:**

- **Real Revenue:** Every shop generates real income from real customers buying real food. This isn't yield farming or liquidity mining — it's commerce.
- **Transparent Operations:** Livestreams from every shop, on-chain sales dashboards, public financial reporting. Token holders see everything.
- **Deflationary Mechanics:** Shop profits buy and burn tokens. More shops = more burn. The token supply only goes down over time.
- **Community Governance:** Token holders act as a board of directors, making high-level strategic decisions while professional operators handle daily execution.
- **No Direct Profit Distribution:** Holders never receive profit payments. Value accrues through token scarcity. This is a critical design choice for both regulatory and economic reasons.

---

## 4. How It Works

### The Business Loop

```
Customer buys shawarma
        ↓
Shop generates revenue
        ↓
Operating costs are paid (rent, staff, ingredients, equipment)
        ↓
Net profit is calculated (publicly visible on dashboard)
        ↓
Designated percentage of profit is sent to Buyback Contract
        ↓
Contract buys SHAMA on open market (DEX)
        ↓
Purchased tokens are permanently burned
        ↓
Total supply decreases → remaining tokens become scarcer
        ↓
Token holders benefit from reduced supply
```

### The Governance Loop

```
Token holder stakes SHAMA
        ↓
Staking weight determines voting power
        ↓
Proposals are submitted on-chain (new locations, budget changes, operator reviews)
        ↓
Community votes during proposal window
        ↓
Approved proposals are executed by operations team
        ↓
Results are visible via livestream and dashboards
```

### The Monitoring Loop

```
Livestream cameras at every shop (kitchen + front counter)
        ↓
POS (Point of Sale) data feeds to public dashboard
        ↓
Daily/weekly/monthly revenue, expenses, net profit — all visible
        ↓
Token holders can flag concerns via governance proposals
        ↓
Quarterly operator performance reviews driven by data
```

## 5. The SHAMA Token

| Property | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Name | SHAMA |
| Total Supply | 1,000,000 (fixed at genesis) |
| Type | ERC-20 (with burn function) |
| Inflation | None — supply only decreases |
| Direct Yield | None — no profit distribution to holders |
| Value Accrual | Deflationary pressure via buyback-and-burn |
| Governance | Staked tokens grant voting power |
| Network | TBD (Ethereum L2 / Solana / Base — to be determined based on gas costs and community input) |

**What SHAMA is:** A governance and deflationary utility token backed by the revenue mechanics of real physical businesses.

**What SHAMA is not:** A security, a profit-sharing instrument, or a promise of financial returns. No one is guaranteed anything. The community works together toward making the businesses successful, and the token mechanics reward long-term alignment.

---

## 6. Tokenomics

### 6.1 Total Supply & Allocation Per Shop

Total fixed supply: **1,000,000 SHAMA**

Tokens are released in tranches tied to each shop setup. Not all tokens are in circulation at launch — they unlock as the business expands.

**Pilot Phase (Shops 1–4): 10,000 tokens per shop**

| Allocation | Percentage | Tokens |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| Team | 40% | 4,000 |
| Stakers | 30% | 3,000 |
| Investors | 30% | 3,000 |
| **Total per shop** | **100%** | **10,000** |

The 40% team allocation during the pilot phase reflects the disproportionate effort required to build the franchise model from scratch — securing locations, establishing supplier relationships, developing operational playbooks, building the tech stack, and proving the concept works. This is founder-stage work.

**Growth Phase (Shops 5–50): 20,000 tokens per shop**

| Allocation | Percentage | Tokens |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| Team | 20% | 4,000 |
| Stakers | 25% | 5,000 |
| Investors | 25% | 5,000 |
| Shop Operator | 15% | 3,000 |
| Treasury / Reserve | 10% | 2,000 |
| Liquidity | 5% | 1,000 |
| **Total per shop** | **100%** | **20,000** |

### 6.2 Supply Math

| Phase | Shops | Tokens/Shop | Subtotal |
|-------|-------|-------------|----------|
| Pilot | 4 | 10,000 | 40,000 |
| Growth | 46 | 20,000 | 920,000 |
| **Total allocated** | **50** | — | **960,000** |
| Ecosystem reserve | — | — | 40,000 |
| **Grand total** | — | — | **1,000,000** |

The remaining 40,000 tokens in the ecosystem reserve are held for: emergency liquidity needs, strategic partnerships, exchange listings, and unforeseen operational requirements. Usage requires governance approval.

### 6.3 Vesting Schedule

All token allocations are subject to vesting. No one receives unlocked tokens at shop launch.

| Recipient | Cliff | Vesting Period | Condition |
|-----------|-------|---------------|-----------|
| Team | 6 months | 12-month linear | Shop must begin payouts |
| Investors | 6 months | 6-month linear | Shop must begin payouts |
| Stakers | 3 months | Monthly distribution | Shop must be cash-flow positive |
| Shop Operator | 6 months | 12-month linear | Performance-based |
| Treasury | No cliff | Governance-controlled | Proposal + vote required |

**Critical condition:** No tokens vest until the associated shop starts making payouts. If a shop fails to become profitable, the associated tokens remain locked. This aligns everyone's incentives toward making the businesses succeed.

---

## 7. Buyback-and-Burn Mechanism

This is the core value engine of the protocol.

### How It Works

1. Each shop's net profit is calculated monthly (revenue minus all operating costs).
2. A designated percentage of net profit (initially 50%, adjustable by governance) is converted to the token's trading currency.
3. Funds are sent to the Buyback-and-Burn smart contract.
4. The contract executes market buys of SHAMA on the designated DEX.
5. All purchased tokens are sent to the burn address (0x000...dead) — permanently removed from supply.
6. Every transaction is recorded on-chain with full transparency.

### Burn Impact Projections

These are illustrative estimates, not guarantees. Actual figures depend on shop performance, location, and market conditions.

| Scenario | Shops Active | Avg Monthly Profit/Shop | Burn Allocation (50%) | Monthly Buy Pressure | Annual Tokens Burned (est.) |
|----------|-------------|------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Early (Year 1) | 4 | $3,000 | $1,500 | $6,000 | Depends on token price |
| Growth (Year 2) | 15 | $4,000 | $2,000 | $30,000 | Accelerating |
| Scale (Year 3) | 40 | $5,000 | $2,500 | $100,000 | Significant supply reduction |

The key insight: burn pressure compounds. Each new profitable shop adds permanent, recurring buy pressure. Unlike speculative demand, this demand is structural — it exists as long as the shops are selling shawarma.

### Burn Transparency

Every burn event is published with:
- Shop identifier
- Revenue for the period
- Operating costs for the period
- Net profit calculation
- Percentage allocated to burn
- DEX transaction hash for the buy
- Burn transaction hash
- Running total of tokens burned to date

This data is displayed on the public dashboard and is independently verifiable on-chain.

---

## 8. Staking Model

### Purpose

Staking serves two functions: it provides governance weight (staked tokens = voting power) and it is the mechanism through which community members earn SHAMA from new shop launches.

### How Staking Rewards Work

Staking rewards are **not** paid from shop profits (those go to buyback-and-burn). Instead, staking rewards come from the staker allocation of each new shop setup.

When Shop #5 launches, 5,000 SHAMA (25% of 20,000) are allocated to the staking pool. These tokens are distributed to stakers proportionally based on their staked amount and lock duration, vested over the staking schedule.

This means: **staking rewards are tied to expansion.** More shops launching = more rewards for stakers. This creates community incentive to actively participate in governance to drive successful expansion.

### Staking Tiers

| Tier | Lock Duration | Reward Multiplier | Governance Weight |
|------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Flexible | No lock | 1.0x | 1.0x |
| Bronze | 3 months | 1.25x | 1.25x |
| Silver | 6 months | 1.5x | 1.5x |
| Gold | 12 months | 2.0x | 2.0x |

Longer locks receive higher reward multipliers and greater voting weight. This rewards commitment and prevents governance attacks from short-term speculators.

### The Elegant Tension

The tokenomics create a natural balance:
- **Expansion emits tokens** (inflationary pressure from new shop allocations)
- **Operating shops burn tokens** (deflationary pressure from buyback-and-burn)
- **At scale**, burn rate exceeds emission rate, and the token becomes net deflationary

This crossover point — where active shops are burning more tokens than new shops are emitting — is when the flywheel fully engages.

---

## 9. Governance Framework

### Philosophy

Token holders function as a **board of directors**, not as day-to-day operators. They set strategy, approve major decisions, and hold operators accountable. They do not decide what sauce goes on the shawarma.

### What Governance Controls

**Strategic decisions (require vote):**
- Approval of new shop locations
- Selection of shop operators
- Major budget allocations (equipment, renovation, marketing campaigns)
- Changes to the franchise fee structure
- Adjustments to buyback-and-burn percentage
- Removal of underperforming operators
- Changes to staking parameters
- Use of treasury/reserve funds
- Partnership and listing decisions

**Operational decisions (handled by operators, NOT voted on):**
- Daily staffing and scheduling
- Ingredient sourcing and menu execution
- Customer service
- Local marketing and promotions
- Equipment maintenance
- Health and safety compliance

### Proposal Process

1. **Submission:** Any staker holding ≥ 0.1% of staked supply can submit a proposal.
2. **Discussion Period:** 7 days for community discussion and debate.
3. **Voting Period:** 5 days for on-chain voting. Quorum requirement: 20% of staked supply must participate.
4. **Execution:** Approved proposals are executed by the operations team within 30 days. Execution is tracked publicly.
5. **Emergency Proposals:** In urgent situations (equipment failure, safety issues), the team can act immediately and submit a retroactive ratification vote within 48 hours.

### Voting Power

Voting power = (staked SHAMA amount) × (tier multiplier)

Example: A holder staking 1,000 SHAMA in the Gold tier (12-month lock) has voting power of 2,000, versus 1,000 for someone with the same amount in the Flexible tier.

---

## 10. Transparency Layer

Transparency is the single most important differentiator. If people can see everything, trust is built organically.

### Livestreams

Every operating shop has livestream cameras covering:
- **Kitchen area:** Food preparation, hygiene standards, workflow
- **Front counter / service area:** Customer flow, service quality
- **No audio** to protect employee and customer privacy

Streams are accessible 24/7 to all SHAMA stakers through the governance portal. Recordings are stored for 30 days.

### Financial Dashboard

A public, real-time dashboard displaying per-shop and aggregate data:

- Daily transaction count and revenue
- Weekly and monthly revenue trends
- Operating cost breakdown (rent, staff, ingredients, equipment, utilities)
- Net profit calculation
- Buyback-and-burn execution history
- Cumulative tokens burned
- Token circulating supply (total minus burned minus locked)

### POS Integration

Point-of-sale systems at each shop feed transaction data to the dashboard. Every sale is logged with timestamp, amount, and payment method. This creates an auditable trail from customer purchase to token burn.

### Quarterly Reports

The operations team publishes quarterly reports covering:
- Financial performance per shop and aggregate
- Operator performance reviews
- Expansion progress and pipeline
- Governance activity summary
- Token supply and burn statistics
- Challenges, risks, and mitigation actions

---

## 11. Smart Contract Architecture

The protocol requires six core contracts:

### 11.1 SHAMA Token Contract
Standard ERC-20 with burn function. Fixed supply of 1,000,000 minted at genesis. No mint function — supply can only decrease. Burn function callable by the Buyback-and-Burn contract and by any holder wishing to burn their own tokens.

### 11.2 Vesting/Lock Contract
Manages all token locks across team, investors, stakers, and operators. Supports multiple vesting schedules with cliff periods and linear unlock. Release is conditional — tokens only begin vesting when the associated shop meets the payout threshold (defined as 3 consecutive months of positive cash flow). Admin functions are controlled by a multisig wallet.

### 11.3 Staking Contract
Accepts SHAMA deposits with configurable lock durations (Flexible, 3-month, 6-month, 12-month). Calculates reward multipliers based on tier. Distributes staking rewards from shop-launch allocations. Tracks governance weight for the voting system.

### 11.4 Buyback-and-Burn Contract
Receives funds from shop operations (converted to on-chain currency). Executes market buys on the designated DEX (e.g., Uniswap, Raydium — depending on chain). Burns all purchased tokens automatically. Emits events for every buy and burn for dashboard tracking. Can be triggered by the operations multisig or automated via time-based execution.

### 11.5 Governance Contract
On-chain proposal and voting system. Proposal submission restricted to stakers above threshold. Configurable quorum and approval requirements. Timelock on execution for security. Supports standard proposals and emergency proposals with different parameters.

### 11.6 Shop Registry Contract
On-chain record of every shop in the network. Stores: shop ID, location (city/country), operator address, launch date, status (pilot/active/paused/closed), cumulative tokens burned, total revenue reported. Updated by the operations multisig. Provides a permanent, tamper-proof record of the business network.

### Security

- All contracts will be audited by a reputable third-party firm before mainnet deployment.
- Critical admin functions are controlled by a multisig wallet (initially 3-of-5, expanding as the team grows).
- Upgrade paths use transparent proxy patterns with timelock delays.
- Bug bounty program will be established post-launch.

---

## 12. Roadmap & Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1–3)

**Objective:** Launch the protocol's digital presence and smart contract infrastructure.

- Launch shawarma.trade website with full whitepaper, tokenomics, and vision
- Develop and deploy smart contracts to testnet
- Third-party smart contract audit
- Build community across Twitter/X, Telegram, Discord
- Begin token sale / initial distribution event
- Publish franchise research and location scouting reports
- Deploy governance portal (beta)

### Phase 2: Pilot Preparation (Months 3–5)

**Objective:** Prepare the first pilot shop for launch.

- Secure pilot location (city and premises)
- Purchase equipment (grills, refrigeration, POS systems, cameras)
- Hire and train initial staff
- Brand the location (signage, interior, packaging)
- Install livestream infrastructure
- Connect POS system to dashboard pipeline
- Deploy smart contracts to mainnet
- Activate staking contract

### Phase 3: Pilot Operations (Months 5–8)

**Objective:** Prove the business model with Shop #1.

- Launch Shop #1 with livestreams active
- Monitor operations and iterate on processes
- Publish weekly financial reports
- Gather community feedback through governance proposals
- Achieve cash-flow positive status (target: within 3 months)
- Begin documenting franchise operations manual
- Plan Shops #2–4 based on learnings

### Phase 4: Pilot Expansion (Months 8–14)

**Objective:** Open Shops #2, #3, and #4. Validate the model across multiple locations.

- Launch remaining pilot shops in sequence (one every 2 months)
- Each shop follows the proven playbook from Shop #1
- Activate buyback-and-burn once shops are profitable
- First token burns occur — verified on-chain
- Begin vesting schedule for pilot shop token allocations
- Refine governance processes based on real usage
- Complete franchise operations manual v1.0

### Phase 5: Growth Phase (Months 14–36)

**Objective:** Scale from 4 to 50 shops using the proven model.

- Open shops in batches of 3–5, each backed by a new token tranche
- Onboard independent shop operators (receiving 15% operator allocation)
- Governance becomes increasingly active and community-driven
- Burn rate accelerates with each new profitable shop
- Cross the deflation threshold (burns > emissions)
- Launch mobile app for stakers (governance, dashboard, livestreams)
- Expand to multiple countries

### Phase 6: Franchise Transition (Month 36+)

**Objective:** After 50 shops, transition to a decentralized franchise model.

- New shops are opened by independent franchisees, not the core team
- Franchisees pay a franchise fee (partially in SHAMA, partially fiat)
- Franchise fee goes to treasury (governed by token holders)
- Core team transitions to a support and standards role
- Governance has full authority over franchise approvals, standards, and expansion
- The protocol becomes a self-sustaining, community-governed franchise network

---

## 13. Franchise Model (Post-50 Shops)

Once the protocol has 50 operating shops with a proven track record, new shop creation transitions from team-led to franchise-led.

### Franchise Structure

**Franchisee requirements:**
- Proven food service or business management experience
- Local market knowledge for proposed location
- Minimum SHAMA stake (amount set by governance)
- Commitment to operational standards, livestreams, and POS integration
- Acceptance of governance oversight

**Franchisee receives:**
- Complete operations manual (recipes, supplier lists, equipment specs, branding guidelines, staff training protocols)
- Access to established supply chain relationships
- Marketing support and brand recognition
- POS and dashboard integration
- Ongoing operational support from the core team

**Franchise fee structure (set by governance):**
- One-time setup fee (covers training, branding kit, system integration)
- Ongoing royalty (percentage of revenue, portion used for buyback-and-burn)
- Required SHAMA stake (locked for duration of franchise agreement)

### Why This Works

By the time the franchise model activates, the protocol will have: 50 shops worth of operational data and refinement, a proven and documented business model, established brand recognition, a functioning governance system with active participants, strong deflationary token mechanics with demonstrated burn history, and a community of aligned stakeholders.

New franchisees are essentially buying into a turnkey system with built-in transparency and accountability.

---

## 14. Risk Factors

Transparency requires honesty about risks. The following are real challenges this project faces.

### Business Risks

**Food service margins are thin.** Net profit margins in food service typically range from 5–15%. A single bad month (equipment failure, ingredient price spike, local competition) can eliminate profitability temporarily. Mitigation: treasury reserves, diversification across multiple locations, and careful cost management.

**Operator quality varies.** The success of each shop depends heavily on its operator. A poorly managed shop can lose money and damage the brand. Mitigation: rigorous operator selection, performance-based token vesting, quarterly reviews with governance-driven accountability, and clear termination procedures.

**Location risk.** Some shop locations will perform better than others. A location that looked promising during due diligence may underperform due to factors outside our control (construction, traffic pattern changes, competitor entry). Mitigation: thorough market research, pilot phase to test assumptions, and willingness to close underperforming locations.

**Scaling challenges.** Managing 4 shops is fundamentally different from managing 50. Supply chain, quality control, brand consistency, and operator management all become exponentially more complex. Mitigation: build the franchise infrastructure incrementally, document everything, and use the growth phase to stress-test systems.

### Token / Crypto Risks

**Regulatory uncertainty.** While the buyback-and-burn model avoids direct profit distribution, regulatory frameworks are evolving. Certain jurisdictions may still classify SHAMA in ways that create compliance obligations. Mitigation: legal counsel in each operating jurisdiction, conservative token design, and no guaranteed returns.

**Liquidity risk.** Early-stage tokens on DEXs can have thin liquidity, leading to price volatility and potential slippage on buyback orders. Mitigation: liquidity allocations from shop token tranches, careful DEX selection, and TWAP (time-weighted average price) execution for buybacks.

**Smart contract risk.** Despite audits, smart contracts can contain vulnerabilities. Mitigation: multiple audits, bug bounty program, upgradeable contracts with timelock, and conservative initial deployment.

### Execution Risks

**Team dependency.** During the pilot phase, the project depends heavily on the core team. Mitigation: document all processes early, begin onboarding independent operators during the growth phase, and design governance to function with decreasing team involvement over time.

**Community governance challenges.** Token-weighted voting can be dominated by large holders, and voter apathy can lead to low quorum rates. Mitigation: staking tier multipliers reward committed holders over whales, quorum requirements prevent low-participation decisions, and active community management to encourage engagement.

---

## 15. Team & Operator Structure

### Core Team (Pilot Phase)

During the pilot phase, the core team handles all aspects of business setup and operations. The team is responsible for: location scouting and lease negotiation, equipment procurement and installation, staff hiring and training, brand development and marketing, smart contract development and deployment, community management and governance facilitation, financial reporting and dashboard maintenance.

The 40% team allocation during the pilot phase compensates for this intensive, high-risk foundational work. As the protocol scales, the team's token allocation per shop decreases to 20%, reflecting the shift from building to supporting.

### Shop Operators (Growth Phase)

Starting from Shop #5, each shop is managed by an independent operator who:
- Has food service or business management experience
- Is hired through a governance-approved process
- Receives 15% of the shop's token allocation (performance-vested)
- Has daily operational authority within the established framework
- Reports monthly to the community via the dashboard
- Is subject to quarterly performance reviews

Operators can be replaced through governance vote if performance benchmarks are not met.

### Long-Term Structure

As the protocol matures, the structure evolves from centralized (team runs everything) to decentralized (franchise operators run shops, governance directs strategy, core team provides infrastructure and support). The end state is a self-sustaining network where the core team's role is maintenance and improvement of the protocol layer, not business operations.

---

## 16. Legal Considerations

### Token Classification

SHAMA is designed as a governance and utility token, not a security. Key design choices supporting this:
- **No profit distribution.** Holders never receive direct payments from shop revenue.
- **No guaranteed returns.** The whitepaper makes no promises about token price appreciation.
- **Active participation required.** Value accrual depends on community governance and collective effort toward business success.
- **Buyback-and-burn is mechanical**, not discretionary — it is a protocol function, not a dividend.

Despite these design choices, regulatory classification is ultimately determined by regulators in each jurisdiction. The project will engage legal counsel in all operating jurisdictions and comply with applicable regulations.

### Jurisdictional Strategy

The initial shops will be launched in jurisdictions with clear and favorable frameworks for blockchain-based business models. Specific jurisdictions will be announced during Phase 2 based on legal review.

### Disclaimers

- SHAMA tokens are not an investment and should not be purchased with the expectation of profit.
- The project involves significant business and technology risks as outlined in Section 14.
- Past performance of pilot shops does not guarantee future results.
- Token holders should only participate with funds they can afford to lose.
- This whitepaper does not constitute financial, legal, or investment advice.

## 17. Conclusion

Shawarma.trade is built on a simple thesis: **crypto needs real businesses, and real businesses need transparent governance.**

Most tokens fail because they have no underlying economic engine. SHAMA has one — physical shops serving real customers, generating real revenue, and mechanically reducing token supply through every transaction. This isn't a promise; it's a business model.

Most DAOs fail because they try to decentralize everything. Shawarma.trade decentralizes what benefits from decentralization (strategic oversight, capital allocation, accountability) and centralizes what requires expertise (daily operations, food preparation, customer service). The token holders are the board. The operators run the kitchen.

The path is straightforward: build pilot shops, prove the model, scale with community capital and governance, and transition to a franchise network that can grow without the core team. Every step is transparent — livestreamed, dashboard-reported, and on-chain verified.

If we execute well, we build something that doesn't exist yet in crypto: a decentralized franchise network where every shawarma sold makes the token scarcer, where every new shop makes the network stronger, and where every token holder has real visibility into real operations.

The mission is simple: **sell shawarma, burn tokens, grow the network.**
